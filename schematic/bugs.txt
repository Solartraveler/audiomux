For a revision 1.1, I suggest fixing:
1.
The footprint of J5-J8 needs elongated holes approx 0.2mm more wide. Its currently difficult to press the plastic holders of the audio connector into it.
2.
U5 and H6 are very close together - its therefore difficult to find a proper of-the-shelf headsink.
3.
The footprint for the light pipes H11 - H15 from kicad has 0.02mm smaller drills than recommend in the datasheet.
The connector of the light pipe fits easily in the front hole, but pressing it in the rear hole is difficult.
Maybe 0.1mm more drilling for the rear hole would be right. Or just use a rasp carefully on the light pipes.
4.
The RX and TX pins are directly connected, if the software is not configured properly, or closing one of the 2.PCB JP6 has been forgotten, two outputs would drive against each other. Resistors in the lines of RX1 and RX2 would be safe here.
5.
While in DFU upload mode, the MCU pulls PA9, PA10 and PA15 high, as a result the relays switch and Inputs 3 and 4 are connected together with mute.
Workaround: While uploading firmware, unplug audio inputs 3 and 4.
6.
The holes and cutout for the mounting screws are 2.7mm wide. Its hard to get 2.6mm screws. Increasing the hole/cutout to 3.0mm would allow the use of much more common 2.9mm screws
7.
The order of the in- and outputs went counter intuitive. Looking at the backside it is:
Out2 Out1 In3  In1
Out4 Out3 In4  In2
