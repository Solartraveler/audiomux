For a revision 1.1, I suggest:
1.
The footprint of J5-J8 needs elongated holes approx 0.2mm more wide. Its currently difficult to press the plastic holders of the audio connector into it.
2.
U5 and H6 are very close together - its therefore difficult to find a proper of-the-shelf headsink.
3.
The footprint for the light pipes H11 - H15 from kicad has 0.02mm smaller drills than recommend in the datasheet.
The connector of the light pipe fits easily in the front hole, but pressing it in the rear hole is difficult.
Maybe 0.1mm more drilling for the rear hole would be right. Or just use a rasp carefully on the light pipes.
